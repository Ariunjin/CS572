        <h1>CS572 Homework 2</h1>
        <pre>1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use <c>setImmediate</c> instead 
            of using <c>setTimeout</c>?</pre>
        <pre>
                When you want to execute some piece of code asynchronously, 
                but as soon as possible, one option is to use the setImmediate() function.

                A setTimeout() callback with a 0ms delay is very similar to setImmediate(). 
                The execution order will depend on various factors, 
                but they will be both run in the next iteration of the event loop.
        </pre>   
        <pre>2. Explain the difference between <c>process.nextTick</c> and 
            <c>setImmediate</c>?</pre>
        <pre>
                A function passed to process.nextTick() is going to be executed on the current 
                iteration of the event loop, after the current operation ends. 
                This means it will always execute before setTimeout and setImmediate.
